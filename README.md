# Falling Ball Simulation
by: Tanner Davison

email: tanner.davison95@gmail.com

## Description

This repository contains a simulation program written in C++ that models the falling of an object from a specified height under gravity. The program calculates and displays the height of the object at each second until it reaches the ground. It demonstrates dynamic memory management, object-oriented programming, and basic physics simulations in C++.

## Features

- **Interactive Height Input:** Allows users to input the initial height of the tower.
- **Falling Simulation:** Calculates and outputs the height of the object at each second as it falls.
- **Dynamic Memory Management:** Uses dynamic memory allocation for managing the height of the tower.
- **Time Simulation:** Simulates the falling process over time, with output updating each second.

## Build the Project

Open the project in Visual Studio or use `cmake` to generate the build files. Build the project using the appropriate tool (Visual Studio, `make`, etc.).

## Run the Simulation

Execute the compiled program. Input the height of the tower when prompted.

## Requirements

- **Visual Studio 2022** (or another compatible C++ compiler)
- **C++11** or later
