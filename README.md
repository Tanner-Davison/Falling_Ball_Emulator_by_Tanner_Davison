# Falling Ball Simulation

## Description

This repository contains a simulation program written in C++ that models the falling of an object from a specified height under gravity. The program calculates and displays the height of the object at each second until it reaches the ground. It demonstrates dynamic memory management, object-oriented programming, and basic physics simulations in C++.

## Features

- **Interactive Height Input:** Allows users to input the initial height of the tower.
- **Falling Simulation:** Calculates and outputs the height of the object at each second as it falls.
- **Dynamic Memory Management:** Uses dynamic memory allocation for managing the height of the tower.
- **Time Simulation:** Simulates the falling process over time, with output updating each second.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tower-simulation.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd tower-simulation
Build the Project:

Open the project in Visual Studio or use cmake to generate the build files.
Build the project using the appropriate tool (Visual Studio, make, etc.).
Run the Simulation:

Execute the compiled program.
Input the height of the tower when prompted.
Requirements
Visual Studio 2022 (or another compatible C++ compiler)
C++11 or later
